# SDC-BehavioralCloning-P3

Overview
---

In this project, I use what we've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The Udacity SDC class provided a simulator where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

Submission Files
--- 
* [model.py](./model.py) - script used to create and train the model
* [drive.py](./drive.py) - script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file
* [model.h5](./model.h5) - a trained Keras model
* a [writeup_report.md](./writeup_report.md) - a final report of this project
* [video.mp4](./video.mp4) - a video recording of my vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap
